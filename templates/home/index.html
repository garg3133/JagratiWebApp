We now look upon the society as a whole rather than focussing on a particular objective. What better way to promote and ignite a light of awareness towards education among kids than to hand them the pivot of education. The books distributed among them kindle in them, the importance of reading and make them realize the wonders a book is capable of bringing into their lives. </p>

Our blood donation camps look forward on doing the same. It received an overwhelming support from the institute and is one of the biggest success of Jagrati till date. The participation of the faculties added to its success. As they say, "karke dekho, achcha lagta hai", it indeed proved true. Medical camps the under privileged who cannot afford getting basic check-ups done were provided with basic fitness tests here in our institute. A step towards a healthy living society is never a failure. </p>

Diyas of the Diwali became all the more bright when lit by those little hands and the crackers were better enjoyed when bursted by them. Be it Rakhsha Bandhan where the little girls tied rakhi or the Navratri where they worshipped Maa Durga, every festival carries millions of memories with it. </p>

It's not too hard to believe that without trees we humans would not exist on this beautiful planet. Unfortunately, our need for trees is more than ever.

The club has identified this problem and has associated itself with this case. Thereby, the Jagrati conducts a plantation drive each year.</p>
